Simply Array is to store multiple values in one variable.

### Syntax:

`const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];` ( Here we assign array literal to the variable *array\_name)*

### Why Arrays?

If we want to store 3 values we can store in three variables like

```javascript
let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";
```

But what if we have to store the 100 values it is a bit more difficult right? So here came the array by using an array we can store the many values in one variable like

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

In an array, the line **breaks** and **spaces** are not considered.

### Creating Array

You can also create an empty array and provide values to it by using indexing.

```javascript
const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";
```

We can also create the array by using the array keyword **new.**

`const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");`

> **Note**: The two examples above do the same.
> 
> There is no need to use `new Array()`.
> 
> For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.

### Accessing Array Elements

You can access an array element by referring to the **index number**. Array index starts with 0 and so on...

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];
```

### Changing an Array Element

`cars[0] = "Opel";` It replaces the 0th index with the value Opel.

### Accessing the Full Array

In JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name.

`console.log(cars);`

### Arrays are Objects

Arrays are a special type of object. The `typeof()` method in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

Arrays use **numbers** `person[0]` to access their "elements".

`const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];`

Objects use **names** `person.firstName` to access their "members".

`const person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age:46};`

### Array Elements Can Be Objects

JavaScript **variables can be objects**. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

**You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array.**

```javascript
myArray[0] = Date.now;
myArray[1] = myFunction;
myArray[2] = myCars;
```

### **Length**

The `length` property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).

### Accessing the Last Array Element

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1];
```

### Looping Array Elements

```javascript
//Using for loop
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fLen = fruits.length;

let text = "<ul>";
for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
  text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
}
text += "</ul>";

//using forEach
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

let text = "<ul>";
fruits.forEach(myFunction);
text += "</ul>";

function myFunction(value) {
  text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
}
```

To add a new element to an array is to use the `array.push(value)` method.

A new element can also be added to an array using the `Array[fruits.length]=value` property.

### Array And Object Diff

In JavaScript, **arrays** use **numbered indexes**.  

In JavaScript, **objects** use **named indexes**.

> **Note:**
> 
> Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.
> 
> JavaScript does **not** support arrays with named indexes(associative arrays).
> 
> In JavaScript, **arrays** always use **numbered indexes**.
> 
> `const person = [];   person[0] = "John";   person[1] = "Doe";   person[2] = 46;   person.length;    // Will return 3   person[0]; //"John"`
> 
> **WARNING :**  
> If you use named indexes, JavaScript will **redefine the array** to an **object**.
> 
> After that, some array methods and properties will produce **incorrect results**.
> 
> `const person = [];   person["firstName"] = "John";   person["lastName"] = "Doe";   person["age"] = 46;   person.length;     // Will return 0   person[0];         // Will return undefined`

## When to Use Arrays and when to use Objects.

* JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
    
* You should use **objects** when you want the element names to be **strings (text)**.
    
* You should use **arrays** when you want the element names to be **numbers**.
